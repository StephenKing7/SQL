only use single quotes for strings... not double quotes
only use '=' for equality... not '=='

SELECT [column1, column2]
FROM [table]
WHERE [condition1] AND [condition2] OR [condition3]
ORDER BY [columnX] DESC (ASC is default);

SELECT DISTINCT [column]  #  Distinct only returns unique values
FROM [table];

SELECT [column]
FROM [table]
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;  #  Return 5 rows starting from row 5

/*  */  #  multiline comments
IS NULL  #  the complete absence of a value
IS NOT NULL  #  must have value or default value

SELECT [column1]
FROM [table]
WHERE [column1] IN ('string1', 'string2')  #  IN is used in WHERE clause to specify list of values matched via 'OR' comparison
ORDERY BY [column1];

The percent sign (%) is a wildcard used with LIKE.  Within a search string, % means, match any number of occurrences of any character (including 0 occurrences)

SELECT [column1], [column2]
FROM [table]
WHERE [column2] LIKE 'name%';

In contrast to %, '_' matches exactly 1 character as a wildcard
